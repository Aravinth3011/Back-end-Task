It's a GUI project using python tkinter and MySQL database.
This project involves designing a database table named "Registration Table" to store essential registration information, such as user details, timestamps, and status. After creating the table, you will use Python to write a set of functions that implement the four CRUD operations:

->Create a database with this name, "userdata"
->create a table with this name, "data"

create table student_register(
   id INT(225) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
   email VARCHAR(225) NOT NULL,
   username VARCHAR(225) NOT NULL,
   password VARCHAR(225) NOT NULL,
);
